## SignalCend

**Your devices are lying to you. I built the fix.**

IoT fleets produce conflicting device state. Race conditions fire automations on stale data. Clock drift corrupts your event sequence. Duplicate webhooks trigger duplicate side effects.

SignalCend is a deterministic multi-signal arbitration API. One endpoint. One authoritative answer. Full signed audit trace. 47ms.
